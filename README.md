# Machine-Learning-
This folder contains a set of typical machine learning exercises along with their solutions implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. The projects cover various ML concepts including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using standard metrics. The notebooks demonstrate step-by-step implementations of algorithms and provide hands-on experience for understanding core machine learning techniques.
